# About this section

In order to learn more python and how pythonic code is written, this section of the repo will look at multiple ways to implement a timer, how those methods work and the potential pros and cons of using those methods.

Some of the methods we will use are:

* The Perf_Counter function
* Using the Perf_Counter in a timer function
* Using the Perf_Counter in a timer class
