CSCI 39538: Homework 2: Recreational Math Spec        Due: 3/24/22

This assignment has multiple parts and is a group project. You will be split into groups on 3/7/22 and it is recommended that you come into class. This assingment is also not the standard kind of assignment you would see in a college class.

Recreational math is mathematics that is done for fun. Most of you might think that such a thing should not exist. But it does, and it could actually be quite fun.

You can see a lot of examples from links on the recrational math [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics).

Here is the goal of this project, to learn about code review and how to spot errors in code. Each group will be a team of ~3 people. Each team mate will choose a unique recreational math problem like:

<ul>
    <li>The Collatz Conjecture</li>
    <li>Generating Prime Numbers</li>
    <li>Generating Perfect Numbers</li>
    <li>Generating Kaprekar Numbers (check out the Kaprekar Constant)</li>
    <li>Finding palindromic patterns like with the number 1089</li>
    <li>Armstrong Numbers or narcissistic numbers</li>
    <li>Amicable Numbers</li>
    <li>And a bunch of other recreational math topics!</li>
</ul>
